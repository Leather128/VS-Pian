# Leather's Funkin' Engine

This is the repository for Leather's Funkin' Engine, an engine created for making and playing mods for Friday Night Funkin'.

## Build Instructions

For build intructions go to [Build.md](https://github.com/Leather128/LeathersFunkinEngine/blob/master/Build.md)

## Features

> Proper Options Menu

This includes things like custom controls, downscroll, middle scroll, opponent note glow, note splashes, etc.

> 1-18 Key Support

What does this mean? Well, now if you want, you can choose a different amount of arrows / keys! (Aka different from 4), this feature only goes up to 18 however, because anything more than that would probably be too intensive and would use a lot of resources (also yes 1 key is a thing lol).

> Full mod support with Polymod!

Support for custom songs, characters, stages, weeks, cutscenes (dialogue, and video!!!! (lots of formats)), all without modifying the source code! All you have to do is follow a guide that I will be making in the future and then you can make as many mods as you want!

> More to come...
